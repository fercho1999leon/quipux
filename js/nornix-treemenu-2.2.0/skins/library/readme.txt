Nornix TreeMenu "Library" Skin

by Steve Greenham 

This simple graphical alternative for the excellent Nornix TreeMenu
was a dream given form by the inspiration of a new personal project.
I am creating a free online audio and music resource archive for 
students and inquisitive minds - Sound-Advice.co.uk.  I wanted a 
reliable and familiar explorer-type tree menu system to deliver 
articles and essays in a book/chapter form. I wasted many hours 
examining 'other' tree menus before I stumbled upon Nornix TreeMenu, 
and I instantly recognised it's potential and it's ease of use.
Nornix TreeMenu saves the day! And Sound-Advice.co.uk was born...
